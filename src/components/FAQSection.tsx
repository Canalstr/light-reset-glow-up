      question: "How much time will I need to commit each day?",
      answer: "The protocol requires minimal time commitmentâ€”just about 15 minutes of focused attention daily. Most of the techniques integrate seamlessly into your existing routine, like adjusting when you open your curtains or when you use certain lights in your home."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this approach suitable for the German climate and lifestyle?",
      answer: "Absolutely! The Light Reset protocol has been specifically adapted for German women, taking into account the unique climate, seasonal light variations, and predominantly indoor lifestyle during winter months. It works within your existing daily routine and provides specific guidance for managing light exposure despite limited natural light during certain seasons."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly will I see results?",
      answer: "Many women notice changes in their energy levels and sleep patterns within 7-10 days of starting the protocol. The most significant improvements typically occur between weeks 3-5 as your body's metabolic systems fully reset and adapt to optimized light exposure patterns."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I need to purchase special equipment?",
      answer: "No expensive equipment is required. The protocol works with simple adjustments to your existing environment. We do recommend a few inexpensive items like specific light bulbs for evening use, but these are optional and affordable alternatives are suggested."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after the 5-week program ends?",
      answer: "After completing the 5-week reset, you'll transition to a simple maintenance protocol that takes just minutes per day. You'll have all the knowledge needed to maintain your results long-term with minimal ongoing effort."
